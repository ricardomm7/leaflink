### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	At the touch of a button, HRM wants to create a team proposal that meets your needs. To do this, it will ask for the competences that this team must have, and the number of persons.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Should the user (HRM) be warned if skills are missing?
>
> **Answer:** The programme makes suggestions for teams and the manager can modify or reject them. The programme should warn of the lack of skills in its changes (or in the modification it simply doesn't show the employees who don't have the skills of the person being changed).

> **Question:** How does it generate the team if there are not enough employees?
> 
> **Answer:** The system should provide information why it can't generate a team.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks
