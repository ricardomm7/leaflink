# US014 - Run tests for inputs of variable size, to observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US13


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Software Quality Assessment Team Manager, I want to run tests for inputs of variable size, to
observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US013
algorithm

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The graphic referring to the asymptotic behavior of the
  execution running time tests should be presented in a time unit
  that allows to distinguish the running times of all tested examples.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency on US013 as there must be at least one algorithm applied to run the tests.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * none
	
* Selected data:
    * none

**Output Data:**

* Test results
* (In)Success of the operation
