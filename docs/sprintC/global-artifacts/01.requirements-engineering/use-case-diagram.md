# Use Case Diagram (UCD)

**In the scope of this project, there is a direct relationship of _1 to 1_ between Use Cases (UC) and User Stories (US).
**

This will be the only document where we use “US/UC”, the rest will be prefixed with "US".

This is the global Use Case Diagram and shows the main functions of the main roles in the application:

**For each Use Case/User Story (UC/US), evidence is provided below of the application of the main activities of the
software development process (requirements, analysis, design, testing and code).**
